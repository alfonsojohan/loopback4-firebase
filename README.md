## Loopback 4 with Firebase Authentication

I had a difficult time integrating Firebase with Loopback 4 authentication mechanism. After going through some examples, reading through Loopback 4 documentation multiple times, I manage to come up with this solution. I hope this project can help those looking to do the same. Once you know what to do, it seems really simple! However, getting here was a hard journey :)
